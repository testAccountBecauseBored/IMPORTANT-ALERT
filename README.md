Very very important info about new tld .zip and .mov

To start, the link below looks like it is going to take you to steam's download page, right?

https://store.steampowered.com∕download∕@steaminstaller.zip

Let that sink in. You clicked a link that said it was going to go to one place, but you got sent to am entirely different site. Imagine if you didn't know much about technology and it started a download for steaminstaller.zip, you would open it, wouldn't you?
