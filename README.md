# IMPORTANT-ALERT
Very very important info about new tld .zip and .mov

To start, the link below looks like it is going to take you to steam's download page, right?

https://store.steampowered.com∕download∕@steaminstaller.zip
         
Well, click it. It should take you to "steaminstaller.zip."
Let that sink in. You clicked a link that said it was going to go to one place, but you got sent to am entirely different site. Imagine if you didn't know much about technology and it started a download for steaminstaller.zip, you would open it, wouldn't you?

## Why This Happens
Basically, I put this unicode character instead off the slashes after the tld (.com, .org, etc):
```
∕
```
It looks similar to a slash, right? I also added the "@." This whole thing works because you can do https://username:password@example.com to log in and you make the computer think you want to visit the website after the "@."

#### Thank you very much for reading!
